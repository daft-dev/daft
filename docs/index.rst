Daft
====

**Daft** renders probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to any output format
your `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ backend supports. This includes
PDF, PNG and many other formats. Both directed and undirected graphs are
supported. You can build your model using a Python script with a few trivial
commands and then render it beautifully for publication in a journal or on
the internet.

**Daft** is particularly well suited for rendering graphs to be included in
LaTeX documents, even documents with non-trivial symbol definitions or
macros.
