**Daft** renders *probabilistic graphical models* (PGMs) or
*directed acyclic graphs* or *Bayesian networks* to PDF or PNG
(or other formats).
It makes use of Python and `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_.
**Daft** is particularly well suited for rendering graphs to be
included in LaTeX documents, even documents with non-trivial symbol
definitions or macros.
