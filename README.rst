**Daft** renders *probabilistic graphical models* (PGMs) to any output
format your `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ backend supports. This
includes PDF, PNG and many other formats. Both directed and undirected
graphs are supported. You can build your model using a Python script with a
few trivial commands and then render it beautifully for publication in a
journal or on the internet.

**Daft** is particularly well suited for rendering graphs to be
included in LaTeX documents, even documents with non-trivial symbol
definitions or macros.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install daft
