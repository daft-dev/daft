**Daft** is a Python package that uses `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
to render pixel-perfect *probabilistic graphical models* for publication
in a journal or on the internet. With a short Python script and an intuitive
model-building syntax you can design directed and undirected graphs and save
them in any formats that matplotlib supports.
